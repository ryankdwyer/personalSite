        I began my career in food retail after graduating from The College of William & Mary. With a data intensive role as a category manager, I was constantly looking to automate or streamline my work flow.
        This need led me to learn Python. Soon, I was spending more time writing Python than doing to my actual job. Looking for a way to change careers, I found Fullstack Academy, where I was trained in fullstack JavaScript for modern web development.
